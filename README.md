## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and responsive design principles. Here are some specific code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 25px;
  font-weight: bolder;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
h1:hover {
  color: var(--Yellow);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and improving my skills with CSS Grid and animations. Additionally, I want to explore more advanced JavaScript techniques to enhance interactivity.

### Useful Resources
